# Similarity-Measure-Between-Sentences

Similarity between two sentences can be approached in multiple ways. This paper proposes a combined scheme of
graph similarity of sentences re-imagined as a set of dependencies and word similarity primarily with the HSO-Similarity
algorithm in order to model gold standards as proposed in SemEval 2012 Task 6 (Semantic Textual Similarity). The
resulting model yields a performance better than the project baseline but with lots of room for improvement if it is to be
improved upon for entering the competition.
